# Stripe Webhook Email Confirmation Solution

## The Problem

The Stripe webhook was not sending confirmation emails after successful checkout sessions, despite the following:

1. The Brevo API key and configuration were working correctly (direct email tests passed)
2. The Stripe webhook was receiving events correctly (Stripe CLI showed 200 OK responses)
3. The webhook handler was extracting the customer email correctly
4. But the emails were not being sent during the normal flow

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Response Handling**: The webhook was returning a 200 OK response too early, before email sending was complete
2. **Error Visibility**: When errors occurred during email sending, they were not properly logged or reported
3. **Type Issues**: There were TypeScript issues with the Stripe API types which were causing subtle problems
4. **Poor Instrumentation**: The webhook lacked detailed logging to diagnose issues
5. **Multiple Listeners**: Having multiple Stripe CLI listeners running simultaneously caused confusion

## The Solution

We implemented an enhanced webhook handler with:

1. **Improved Logging**: Time-stamped logs that show every step of the process
2. **Enhanced Response**: The webhook now returns detailed information about email sending status
3. **Robust Email Extraction**: Multiple methods to extract customer emails from various locations in the session
4. **Proper TypeScript Types**: Fixed TypeScript issues with the Stripe API
5. **Detailed Error Handling**: Better error capturing and reporting

## Key Code Improvements

### Enhanced Response Format

```typescript
return res.status(200).json({
  received: true,
  event_type: event.type,
  email_sent: emailResult.success,
  email_details: emailResult.success 
    ? { messageId: emailResult.messageId } 
    : { error: emailResult.error }
});
```

### Better Email Extraction Logic

```typescript
// Check customer_details first
if (session.customer_details && session.customer_details.email) {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] Found email in customer_details`);
  customerEmail = session.customer_details.email;
  return customerEmail;
}

// Check other possible locations...
```

### Proper TypeScript Type Handling

```typescript
// Initialize Stripe
const stripe = new Stripe(stripeSecretKey, {
  apiVersion: '2025-02-24.acacia',
});
```

## Testing Verification

We created comprehensive tests that:

1. Verified the Brevo API works directly
2. Tested the enhanced webhook with email confirmation
3. Compared with the original webhook 
4. Confirmed the solution works with actual Stripe webhook events

## Deployment Instructions

1. Make sure only one Stripe CLI listener is running, forwarding to `/api/webhook`
2. Ensure all required environment variables are set:
   - `BREVO_API_KEY`
   - `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `STRIPE_CLI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (for local testing)
   - `DEBUG_WEBHOOK` (set to 'true' for local testing, remove in production)

3. Monitor the Next.js server logs for any issues

## Development vs. Production

### Development Mode:
- Set `DEBUG_WEBHOOK=true` in .env.local
- Use `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhook`
- Set `STRIPE_CLI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the webhook signing secret shown by the Stripe CLI

### Production Mode:
- Remove `DEBUG_WEBHOOK` or set to 'false'
- Configure Stripe dashboard to send webhooks to your production endpoint
- Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the webhook signing secret from the Stripe dashboard

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a queue system for email sending to handle high volumes
2. Add webhook event logging to a database for tracking and retry
3. Set up monitoring alerts for webhook failures
4. Add regular automated tests of the webhook functionality
