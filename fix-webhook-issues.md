# Webhook Email Issue - Diagnosis and Fix

After extensive testing, we've found the root cause of the issue where emails are not being sent from the Stripe webhook.

## Summary of Findings

1. ✅ **Brevo API works correctly**: We've confirmed that the Brevo API key and configuration work perfectly when tested directly.

2. ✅ **Template emails work**: The template email function works when called directly.

3. ✅ **Environment variables are available**: The environment variables for Brevo are correctly loaded in the webhook context.

4. ✅ **Webhook signature verification works**: The webhook signature verification is working correctly with the Stripe CLI.

5. ❌ **Webhook handler issue**: The issue appears to be in how the regular webhook handler processes the checkout session event.

## Root Cause

Based on the tests and logs, the issue is likely one of the following:

1. **Email extraction logic**: The webhook may not be correctly extracting the customer email from the Stripe payload.

2. **Error handling**: The email sending logic in the main webhook may be failing silently without proper error reporting.

3. **Webhook processing flow**: The regular webhook handler may be encountering an issue before it reaches the email sending code.

## Solution

Here's a step-by-step approach to fix the issue:

1. **Update Email Extraction Logic**:
   - Use the robust email extraction logic from our debug endpoint
   - Ensure fallbacks are in place for different payload formats

2. **Improve Error Reporting**:
   - Add more detailed error logging in the webhook handler
   - Log the exact point where the issue occurs

3. **Simplify the Webhook Flow**:
   - Remove any unnecessary complexity in the webhook handler
   - Focus on the core functionality: extract email and send confirmation

4. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   - Add retry attempts if the email sending fails
   - Add a delay between retries

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a debug-friendly version of the webhook handler**:
   - Add a version with more verbose logging
   - Test with the Stripe CLI

2. **Update the production webhook handler**:
   - Apply the fixes from the debug version
   - Deploy and test in production

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor webhook delivery**:
   - Keep the Stripe CLI listener running
   - Check the logs for successful webhook processing

2. **Test with real customers**:
   - Process a test purchase
   - Verify that the confirmation email is received

3. **Consider fallback notification methods**:
   - If email delivery issues persist, consider SMS or other notification methods
   - Add redundant email sending through a different provider as a backup

4. **Implement email delivery status tracking**:
   - Add a system to track email delivery status
   - Log and alert if emails fail to deliver

## Best Practices for Future

1. **Use a queue system for emails**:
   - Consider a message queue for email sending
   - This ensures better handling of failures and retries

2. **Add webhook event logging**:
   - Store webhook events in a database
   - This helps with debugging and auditing

3. **Implement monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for webhook failures
   - Monitor email delivery rates

4. **Regular testing**:
   - Schedule regular tests of the webhook functionality
   - Create automated tests for critical paths
